This is a simple working API that is used to teach the principles of application deployment.

## Installing NodeJS

You will need to install the Node Version Manager tool which you can then use to install the latest stable version of NodeJS `node` and the Node Package Manager `npm`. Once this is installed you need to install the packages specified by `package.json`.
```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/master/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc
nvm list-remote
nvm install 7.1.0
npm install
```
